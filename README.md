# Single-Thread-CLI
 This project consisted of building a single-threaded CLI that functioned in either file mode or interactive mode. The CLI took in some of the basic commands such as "ls", "pwd", "mkdir", "cd", "cp", "mv", "rm", and "cat".  To run the CLI in interactive mode, simply type ./a.out. Upon running this execution, a CLI looking interface will be prompted and any of the above commands will run as they would on a typical CLI.  To run the CLI in file mode, simply type ./a.out followed by a file that contains commands either seperated by a semicolon or a single command per line in each file. All of the proper commands will be executed just like on a regular CLI.  All of the code is written in C.
